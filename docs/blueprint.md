## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to convey expertise and sophistication, without being as ubiquitous as blue.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), almost black, for a modern, serious feel. This color provides a dark theme with enough detail that elements don't disappear.
- Accent color: Light green (#90EE90), to highlight important sections and buttons, and offer contrast and a vibrant feel.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Space Grotesk gives a contemporary, techy feel for headlines, while Inter provides a clean, readable style for longer text blocks.
- Implement subtle, smooth motion animations in the hero section to create an engaging and dynamic introduction. Animations should be sophisticated and not distracting, enhancing the user experience without being overwhelming.
- Use smooth page transitions to provide a seamless and fluid navigation experience. Transitions should be elegant and efficient.
- Employ a clean and minimalist layout to focus on content, ensure readability, and provide easy navigation. The design should be modern and professional, reflecting Victor Damilola's expertise as a Javascript developer.
